  "comment": "A Liquid Robotics SV3 v300 Wave Glider was deployed outside the Halifax Harbour with a towed Innovasea VM4-WG to listen for acoustically tagged animals. The glider was also equipped with an Airmar 200WX weather station and Liquid Robotics GPSWaves wave height sensor mounted to masts on top of the float, Airmar DX900+ water speed sensor mounted forward thru-hull and two Innovasea VMTs mounted to the front of the sub assembly with one hydrophone head pointed up, one hydrophone head pointed down. \r\n\r\nThe glider will transit to eastern Newfoundland to perform a survey for acoustically tagged Atlantic salmon.\r\n\r\nAfter this mission, the glider will continue on to perform an acoustic survey for the HaliBT mission and remote offloads of OTN VR4 receivers.",
