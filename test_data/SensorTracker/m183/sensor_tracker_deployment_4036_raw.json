  "comment": "The glider was deployed on June 21, 2021 for the ESRF Atlantic salmon tracking project (mission#133). That mission ended Sept 18th, 2021 and the glider continued directly into the 2021 OTN snow crab tracking study.\r\n\r\nA Liquid Robotics SV3 v300 Wave Glider was deployed with a towed Innovasea VM4-WG to listen for acoustically tagged animals and offload data from bottom-mounted Innovasea VR4 receivers. \r\n\r\nThe glider was also equipped with float mounted Airmar 200WX weather station, Liquid Robotics GPSWaves wave height sensor, Airmar DX900+ water speed sensor, and Seabird GPCTD and dissolved oxygen sensor, as well as two sub-mounted Innovasea VMTs with one hydrophone head pointed up, one hydrophone head pointed down. Two APUs were installed for additional power.\r\n\r\nThis glider had previously completed the ESRF survey and NCAT VR4 receiver data offloads and is continuing to do the Sydney Bight snow crab survey for Emera.",
