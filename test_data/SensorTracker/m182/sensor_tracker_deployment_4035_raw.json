  "comment": "A Liquid Robotics SV3 v300 Wave Glider was deployed with a towed Innovasea VM4-WG with the ability to offload Innovasea VR4 acoustic receivers. The glider was also equipped with an Airmar 200WX weather station and Liquid Robotics GPSWaves wave height sensor mounted to masts on top of the float, Airmar DX900+ water speed sensor mounted forward thru-hull and two Innovasea VMTs mounted to the front of the sub assembly with one hydrophone head pointed up, one hydrophone head pointed down. \r\n\r\nThe glider will offload VR4 receivers in the OTN Gully and Halifax Line.",
