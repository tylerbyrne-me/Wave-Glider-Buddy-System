  "comment": "A Liquid Robotics SV3 v300 Wave Glider was deployed with a towed Innovasea VM4-WG to listen for acoustically tagged animals. The glider was also equipped with an Airmar 200WX weather station and Liquid Robotics GPSWaves wave height sensor mounted to masts on top of the float, Airmar DX900+ water speed sensor mounted forward thru-hull and two Innovasea VMTs mounted to the front of the sub assembly with one hydrophone head pointed up, one hydrophone head pointed down. \r\n\r\nThe glider will patrol a known hotspot on the eastern Scotian Shelf for acoustically tagged juvenile and adult Atlantic halibut.\r\n\r\nAfter this mission, the glider will continue on to perform remote offloads of OTN VR4 receivers.",
