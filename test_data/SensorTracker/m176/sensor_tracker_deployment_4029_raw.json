  "comment": "A Liquid Robotics SV3 v300 Wave Glider was deployed with a towed Innovasea VM4-WG to listen for acoustically tagged animals and offload data from bottom-mounted Innovasea VR4 receivers. \r\n\r\nThe glider was also equipped with float mounted Airmar 200WX weather station, Liquid Robotics GPSWaves wave height sensor, Airmar DX900+ water speed sensor, and Seabird GPCTD and dissolved oxygen sensor, as well as two sub-mounted Innovasea VMTs with one hydrophone head pointed up, one hydrophone head pointed down. Two APUs were installed for additional power.\r\n\r\nThis glider had previously completed the ESRF survey and is continuing on to offload data from the NCAT receiver array.\r\n\r\nWas supposed to offload the CBS array as well, but the VM4 stopped communicating with the science computer.",
